## Difference between HTML and JSX
1.  In HTML, event names are written in lowercase, however in React, they are written in camelCase.
2.  In HTML, we may avoid default behavior by returning false, but in React, we must call preventDefault() explicitly
3.  different between HTML and reactIn HTML, the function is called by inserting "()" to the function name. If we don't want to utilize this way, we may use addEventLisener to provide events and listeners, however in React, we require the method name without the "()" appended.

## why can't browser read JS
XBecause JSX is not valid JavaScript, browsers can't read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React.
